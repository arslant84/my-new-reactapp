# Unsplash Image Search App

This is a React course project for the "Frontend Advanced" course.

## Project Description
A modern web application for searching and viewing images using the Unsplash API. The app demonstrates advanced React concepts, modular architecture, form validation, responsive design, and best practices for frontend development.

## Features
- **Image Search:** Search Unsplash for images by keywords.
- **Responsive Gallery:** Adaptive grid layout for images with infinite scroll (lazy loading).
- **Full Image View:** Click any image to view it in a modal with details.
- **Form Validation:** Uses `react-hook-form` and `zod` for robust form validation.
- **Routing:** Multi-page navigation with `react-router-dom` (Home, About, Contacts, NotFound).
- **Modern UI:** Clean, adaptive design with CSS modules.
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for API and validation errors.

## Technologies Used
- React (functional components & hooks)
- Vite (build tool)
- react-router-dom (routing)
- react-hook-form + zod (form validation)
- Axios (API requests)
